@EagleTrooper let's use this instead
to save blowing up the recruiters notifications
on recruitment
EagleTrooper — Today at 8:23 PM
Yeah keep the recruitment clean. I understand Im a recruiter / NCO / admin for the community in involved in.
Alright,
I am working on developing a dashboard that gives historical stats with our server as well as our missions that run Performance / FPS / Memory Usage / etc. During my research i came across your groups Repo and it appears that you are doing something very similar to what I wanted to do. I did read through just to get an idea unfortunately there was some gaps in the implementation and i was hoping to speak to someone about how it was done with your group as well as if they would be so kind as to provide pointers and insight so that I may implement something very similar.

Do you know how to setup a Grafana/InfluxDB stack?
EagleTrooper — Today at 8:27 PM
Already have it setup (Background in IT and Cloud Network Engineering).

It's basically just arma -> influx -> grafana
Sweetwater.I — Today at 8:28 PM
but yeah, influxdb+grafana is what we do
Jarvis — Today at 8:28 PM
The cavmetrics addon you see is the arma extension
EagleTrooper — Today at 8:28 PM
Yep understood the workflow and that was very clear. I believe the piece im missing or dont understand is the dll creation / implementation
Jarvis — Today at 8:28 PM
If you know influx/grafana, you're 2/3rds of the way there

Just git clone the cavmetrics repo
EagleTrooper — Today at 8:29 PM
I believe it was the Arma-Influx?
That was the  piece that i was not clear on. Unless i was misunderstanding it still required a compiled DLL
Jarvis — Today at 8:29 PM
the a3_influx dll is inside of the git repo
so == a DLL but linux
we run our servers on linux
EagleTrooper — Today at 8:30 PM
Unfortuantly it looks like its a .so
Sweetwater.I — Today at 8:30 PM
use the arma-influx repo to build the extension
EagleTrooper — Today at 8:30 PM
Yeah we have windows :/
Sweetwater.I — Today at 8:30 PM
cavmetrics is what we called the packaged extension.
on the repo

Just compile that for dll
it's an arma ext written in go
Liber.N — Today at 8:31 PM
Cavmetrics is an arma addon thats calls to arma influx extension
Jarvis — Today at 8:31 PM
you'll need to change the makefile on that repo tho
EagleTrooper — Today at 8:32 PM
does it need to be labeld armago? or a3influx?
If that is what your referring to then it appears i do have an understanding of it and something else is missing outside of my imediate understanding and may not have anything you can provide input on. I will review the implementation again and see if I can get any further.
I do appreciate the input and help.

no probs, it's a long road but found it worth it in the end

I will take a look! Keep on Keeping on and again I appreciate the friendly response!
Jarvis — Today at 8:36 PM
You'll need to update these for your influx db host - https://github.com/7Cav/cav_metrics/blob/dev/%40CavMetrics/addons/CavMetrics/functions/fn_send.sqf#L9-L12
